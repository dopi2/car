      <h1>About us</h1>
      <h2>Frank & Co founded the Retro in Nigeria in 2024</h2>
      <p>Founded in 2024, Retro was born out of a desire to celebrate and preserve the timeless elegance of vintage cars. It all started when our founder, Frank , restored their first classic car—a 1967 Ford Mustang —which ignited a lifelong passion. Since then, we have grown from a personal project into a hub for collectors, restorers, and anyone who appreciates the artistry and engineering of vintage vehicles.</p>
